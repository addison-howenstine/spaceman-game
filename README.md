First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2016

Use keyboard commands to navigate the game and Save Mark Watney!

In Level 1 you are the astronaut trying to move around the screen and dock on 
with the spacecraft for 5 seconds by matching its position and velocity on the 
screen. You cannot lose in Level 1, it is there for you to get comfortable with
navigating on the screen. When you win, you will be promted to continue to Level 2.

In Level 2 you can switch between controlling the astronaut and controlling the
spacecraft by pressing the [SPACEBAR]. An asteroid will kill the astronaut on impact
but the spacecraft will destroy the asteroid on impact. Destroy all the asteroids
and then save your astronaut by docking the same as in Level 1.

**In either Level 1 or Level 2 you can also win by pressing [W]. The game can be
ticky to get the hang of, but once you do it can be pretty simple and really fun.
I find it easiest to match the velocity and direction of the spacecraft and then
navigate in closer to the spacecraft then try to back up and hold still.**
