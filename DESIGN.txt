SAVE MARK WATNEY!

This game is a space and physics based game similar to Asteroids. You are an astronaut 
floating in space with a limited supply of oxygen left in your suit. Your spacecraft is
traveling at a random trajectory and velocity, and you need to get on board before you
run out of oxygen. Use your arrow keys to rotate and accelerate forwards and backwards
until you are able to lock on board with your spacecraft for five secondsâ€”-or until 
it's too late.

Left and Right arrow keys rotate your position counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively,
and forward and backward arrows accelerate you forward and backwards, respectively.

There are two modes: beginner and advanced. In beginner mode there are no obstacles to
keep you from reaching your spacecraft, but in advanced, there are asteroids that can, if
they collide with the spacecraft or yourself, throw you off course.
